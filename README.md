# 16pads

16pads is a collection of free MPC sound packs for music production and live. All the packs are free and can be used in personal or commercial projects. These packs have been created with existing royalty free sounds find on the web. The original idea was to create an interactive way of sharing sounds packs for music production. You can browse different packs in collection section and listen sounds by clicking on pads. This project is mainly a concept for my portfolio but feel free to contact me if you would love to see new packs published, give me suggestions to improve them, report a bug or give me any advice you think is useful.
